# Analytical Figures for Self-Fulfilling Debt Dilution

The code is written in Julia 1.4. 

You need the following packages:

    Parameters
    PGFPlotsX
    Roots

As well as a working LaTeX installation. 

The code generates figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and D.1 from 

- Aguiar, Mark and Manuel Amador, ["Self-fulfilling Debt Dilution: Maturity and 
    Multiplicity in Sovereign Debt Models"](https://amadormanuel.me/files/self_fulfilling_dilution.pdf) 

The file `main.jl` uses the analytical closed-form solutions in the paper 
to make and save the figures to the `Figures` subdirectory.
